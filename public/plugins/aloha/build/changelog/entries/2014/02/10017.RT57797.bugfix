align-plugin: align only applies to the selected paragraphs.
When selecting several paragraphs and these paragraphs are wrapped in a block element which is not the editing host,
the align style was set into the block element instead of into the paragraphs. With these changes the align style is
only applied to the selected paragraphs.

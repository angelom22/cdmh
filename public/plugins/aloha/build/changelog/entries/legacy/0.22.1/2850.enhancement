 The Block Plugin now allows you to configure your own root tags for block creation. Every time you create a new block, the block plugin will check if its root node is supported. You may now change the roots nodes and use your own list root tags. If you want to use Aloha Blocks drag'n drop functionalities we strongly suggest that you do not use other root tags than div and span. See the guides at http://www.aloha-editor.org/guides/plugin_block.html for further information.

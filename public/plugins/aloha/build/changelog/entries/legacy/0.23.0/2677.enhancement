The Ephmera API was changed aloha-cleanme class has been renamed to aloha-ephemera. aloha-ui-* classes have been renamed to aloha-ephemera-*. Ephemera.ephemera() now doesn't merge the given value any more, but sets it (see function documentation for more information).
	ephemera.attrMap doesn't accept 'ELEMENT.attribute': true entries any more, instead use 'attribute': ['ELEMENT'].
	The mark* functions are now optional (modifications performed by these functions are documented and part of the API).

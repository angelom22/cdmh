Changed the aloha-smart-content-changed event

The snapshotContent property provided bythe
aloha-smart-content-changed event was replaced with the
getSnapshotContent property which is a function that must be
called to retrieve the value that was provided by snapshotContent.

This was done to make snapshotting of the editable contents
optional, since it is a very expensive operation.

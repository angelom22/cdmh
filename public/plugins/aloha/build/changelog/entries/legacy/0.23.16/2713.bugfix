      cite-plugin: Several issues with the citation plugin have been fixed: Pressing backspace in a blockquote will no longer wrap the blockquote into div's (which would break the behaviour). The behaviour of pressing enter at the end of a blockquote multiple times has been changed to land in a new empty paragraph after the blockquote (similar to lists). When blockquote and quotes are nested, the controls of blockquote and quote will both show the correct status now.

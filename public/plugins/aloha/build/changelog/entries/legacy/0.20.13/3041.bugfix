 commands: Fixed possible browser hang (due to an infinite loop) that occurred, when using the command 'inserthtml' to insert content into an editable span, that is not allowed inside a span (e.g. a h1). This browser hang could occur when using the paste plugin to paste content, since that uses the command 'inserthtml'.

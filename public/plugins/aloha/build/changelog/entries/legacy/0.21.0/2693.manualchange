requirejs is not loaded as part of Aloha-Editor

    For aloha development the user must now load requirejs himself
    before loading aloha.js.

    When using a built version of Aloha, it's possible to choose between
    aloha-bare.js, which doesn't include requirejs (or jQuery), and
    aloha-full.js, which does include requirejs (and jQuery).

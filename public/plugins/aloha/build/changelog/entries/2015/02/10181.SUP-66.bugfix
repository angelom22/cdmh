When editing pages having the style "direction" set to "rtl", the aloha editor controls like
the toolbar, sidebar and repository browser were also affected, so its layout and some functionality were broken.
This has been changed, so that all aloha editor controls will have "direction" set to "ltr" regardless of the
page setting.

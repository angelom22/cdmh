copy-paste: Copy and paste text content from MS-Word to Aloha content
              in IE9 Browser, added line break between paragraphs. When
              copying from MS-Word unrendered whitespaces are added between
              paragraphs and are rendered as lines break for Aloha Editor.
              Removing these unrendered whitespaces solves the line break problem.

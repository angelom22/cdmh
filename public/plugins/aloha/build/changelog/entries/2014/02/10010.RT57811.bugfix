'span' elements surrounding inline blocks set as ephemeral.
To be able to set the caret after inline blocks, empty 'span' elements are added at the
beginning and the end of all inline blocks. When saving the page, these elements were saved too. 
With this fix these 'span' are ephemeral and are deleted once the page is saved.
These 'span' elements are removed if the inline blocks are removed.

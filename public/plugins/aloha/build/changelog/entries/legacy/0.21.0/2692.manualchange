The jquery.store and jquery.json plugins have been removed

    The jquery.store plugin was used for persisting the floating menu
    position and pinned state. The functionality provided by
    jquery.store has been replaced with amplify.store.

    The jquery.json plugin has been removed since the functionality
    provided by this module is already provided by util/json2.

    This also fixes the problem that pinning the floating menu was not
    persisted in IE8 and below.

Copy paste tables from MS Word to IE does not create several tables.

When copying and pasting tables from Word to IE several tables were created, one table for each row,
instead of one unique table. This was due to 2 problems: the generic content handler was not set and
a bug in the pasting code. Generic content handler sanitizes the copied content. The second problem
is that an element is unwrapped if this is the only element in the paragraph. If the element is a Table
the unwrap should not be done. For Firefox or Chrome this not happens because the paragraph has always
more than one element, it contains empty elements.

listenforcer-plugin: The listenforcer plugin was refactored.
                  Method names were changed and the way the plugin works with
				  lists was also changed. It will now no longer replace list
				  dom elments. Instead it will move sibling lists into the
				  first list element within the editable. Previously the whole
				  element was replaced and thus the selection was lost. This
				  caused problems with the floating menu. The user had to click
				  two times into a list to make the floating menu appear since
				  the selection was lost due to dom replacements. This is now
				  fixed.

ctrl-c or ctrl-x inside a table copies or cuts the selected text.

When the key commands ctrl-c(copy) or ctrl-x(cut) are pressed the whole table was selected.
This is due to a feature that sets the selection to the whole block when copying or cutting via key commands.
With this fix, the selection of the whole block is only done if the block is not a table.

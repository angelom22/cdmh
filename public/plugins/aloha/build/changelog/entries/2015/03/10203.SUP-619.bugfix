When using Internet Explorer, it was possible to navigate the cursor
into non-editable areas (blocks), because the contenteditable implementation
of IE is broken. This fix will move the cursor out of the non-editable area in
such cases. Additionally, it prevents inserting text into non-editable areas with
the keyboard, in cases where moving the cursor out did not work for some reasons.

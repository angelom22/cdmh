core: (Internet Explorer) When using the cursor keys to move the
              cursor up and down across blocks (non editable areas) it was possible
              to actually place the cursor inside the block. The cursor would be
              trapped in this state and using the cursor up/down keys would scroll
              the page up and down (with some strange rendering of the cursor).
              This has been fixed now to prevent entering non editable areas with
              the cursor.

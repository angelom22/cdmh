 wai-lang-plugin: The plugin now supports both ISO-639-1 (two letter) and ISO-639-2 (three letter) language codes. The languages can be searched in english or german (depending on the user's locale). Additionally, it is now possible to switch on/off the display of country flags when searching for language codes.

Several files have been removed

    - src/lib/aloha/ext-alohatreeloader.js
    - src/lib/aloha/ui-browser.js
    - src/lib/aloha/ecma5.js

    These files are not in use by any of the main Aloha plugins and as
    such are deemed obsolete. These files were never loaded and their
    removal should not have any side-effect.

    Custom plugins should be checked for a possible dependency on these
    files.

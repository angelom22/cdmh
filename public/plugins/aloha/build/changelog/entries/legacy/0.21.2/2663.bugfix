block-plugin: Fixes problem in how droppable containers were being
		   determined while drapping blocks.  The algorithm was miss-identifing
		   any container that had a <br> tags with the "aloha-end-br" class as
		   an "empty" container, even if it contained other content along with
		   the propping <br>.  We now use a stricter check to remove this false
		   positive.
